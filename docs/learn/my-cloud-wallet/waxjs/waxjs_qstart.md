# MyCloudWallet Quickstart

When users sign up or sign in to MyCloudWallet, a WAX Blockchain Account is automatically created. Users can easily manage their resources, blockchain transactions, NFTs, and whitelisted dApps from the MyCloudWallet dashboard. 

In this guide, you'll learn how to use **WaxJS** to connect to the MyCloudWallet, allowing you to:

* Sign in users with Google, Facebook, Twitter, KakaoTalk, Reddit, and other social platforms
* Get blockchain account names, public keys, and permissions
* Easily execute smart contract transactions from your client

Note: 
In the next few sections, we'll go over how everything works. If you'd like to jump right to the code and run our live WaxJS example, refer to [WaxJS Demo](/learn/my-cloud-wallet/waxjs/waxjs_demo).
